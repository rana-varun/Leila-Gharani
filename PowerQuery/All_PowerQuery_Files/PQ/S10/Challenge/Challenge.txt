This is your time to test your knowledge:

1. Import the data from the Excel files inside the current folder.
Only include Excel files that start with HR_ and sheet HR.

2. Combine the data into a table that includes the following fields:

Department -> Take this from the File Name
Name -> This should be first name and last name combined into one Name column
Position -> Table headers from the individual files
Salary -> Values from the individual files 

3. Test your setup by changing the file name "ForLater_Legal.xlsx" to "HR_Legal.xlsx"
