This is your time to test your knowledge:

1. Import the data from the Excel file "SourceData_CellNames.xlsx" (we need data from all tabs)

2. Append the data into a single table

3. Make sure the first column is for Company name.

Hint: Company name will always be in the B column in front of the word "Company".
Use this to figure out how to extract company name to its own column.
